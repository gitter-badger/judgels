Judgels has been designed to support many types of contests and problems. Judgels is also targeted to be used in the 2015 Asia Pacific International Olympiad, held by Indonesia.

## Usage
Judgels currently is in beta version and has not been released yet. To use Judgels, anyone can just clone the git repository and setup the configuration in their own local machines.
The git repository is intended for everyone interested in contributing or seeing how the code works.

We currently have set up an online version of Uriel [http://competition.ia-toki.org](http://competition.ia-toki.org). **Note: [http://competition.ia-toki.org](http://competition.ia-toki.org) is not always online at the moment.**

## Support
We are currently still working on the documentation of Judgels. Stay tuned, we will provide the link soon.
